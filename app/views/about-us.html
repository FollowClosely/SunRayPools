About Sun Ray Pools
At Sun Ray Pools, we build quality swimming pools. Our specialty is building inground gunite pools. We serve Rockwall, McKinney, Plano and the entire Dallas Metroplex. We listen to your ideas, and together we create the swimming pool you've dreamed about and worked hard to own. From design to installation, we are with you every step of the way. 
 
We provide on-site supervision with every step of the construction of your pool. That is how we finish pools on time as promised. We pay attention to detail and communicate with the customer. When you build with Sun Ray Pools, you don't talk to an answering machine, you communicate with a trained pool professional who is aware of the status of your pool, and can answer your questions. Simple concept, tried and proven and it works!
 
Weâ€™re also the home of the innovative energy-saving and time-saving "Deep Heat" feature. Click here to learn more.
 
Sun Ray Pools . . . Where quality and pride of workmanship still matter!
